# Interview-Question-Answers

I do my best to answer common interview questions here in Javascript.

The questions here are recent questions asked by big technology companies such as `Facebook`, `Twitter`, `AirBnB`, `Uber`, `LikedIn`, `Apple`, `Microsoft` to name a few.

## How do I get the question?

I subscribed to **Daily Intervew Pro** at [TechSeries](http://techseries.dev/daily).

They charge `$9` per month for the solutions, but I want to research the solutions myself, so I didn't subscribe. There is fun n adventure!

The questions are in Python but I prefer to answer in Javascript for now.

I might open a repository for the python version of this repository later on.

### Note

Any answer you see here are those I've taken my time to understand.
